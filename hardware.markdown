## Open-Source MRI-Conditional Needle Guiding Manipulator Project

[Go to the project page](https://github.com/OpenSmartTemplate)

The goal is to provide a 3D printable needle-guiding manipulator as an example open-source medical robotics platform.
Needle placement is essential in cancer care for procedures such as biopsies and thermal ablations. As modern diagnostic technologies enable the detection of smaller tumors, the demand for precise needle placement has increased significantly. Prior studies have explored robotic assistance to enhance the safety and accuracy of needle placement in response to this clinical need. However, clinical translation remains challenging, partly due to the lack of accessible research platforms. This project aims to develop an open-source robotics research platform for MRI-guided needle placement, which can be assembled from 3D-printed parts and readily available components.
